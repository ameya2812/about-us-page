									<h1>MINDSPARK'20</h1>
								    <h2>VERSION 13.0</h2>
									<h3>MindSpark is the annual, national level technical festival of College of Engineering, Pune. Entering into its 13th edition this year, MindSpark has grown multifold to become one of the biggest technical college fests in the country. Being a complete student-organized festival, we would have never reached the position we ﬁnd ourselves at today without the support of our endearing Faculty, the Sponsors and our beloved Alumni. MindSpark has grown to receive a footfall of 22,000 every year. The 3-day extravaganza comprises of 55+ events, a Keynote Lecture series, an Overseas Education Fair and a Technical Exhibition to note some of the attractions. A Workshop series, both In-house and Outreach take place a fortnight before the festival. We, at MindSpark, believe that the youth has certain responsibilities towards the society and we aim to fulﬁll those through our social initiative, Paakhi. This year, not only do we wish to carry forward this wonderful legacy but also to stretch our limits and broaden our horizons. We invite you to share the same vision and help us carry forward the baton of Technical Excellence.</h>

										<h3>A TECHNO-PANORAMA</h3>
										<p>Technology evolves and improves every second, every moment. Each and every change, small or large is driven by a purpose or a cause. The primary purpose of change is to solve an existing problem or to clear a lag. The theme for our 13th edition is ‘MindSpark’19: A Techno-panorama’.  A panorama is an unbroken view of an entire area. By a techno-panorama, we aim to depict the transformation of technology over the years and eras. Over the years, Technology has grown by leaps and bounds. But Science and Technology has still not found answers to some existing questions. By depicting the evolution of technology, we aim to let people of this generation reach out to the technologies of the preceding generation. The answer to most of the questions can be found out from the basics. Hence, whenever there is a problem, we generally go back to the basics and resurrect our progress. Understanding how things have evolved will help us improve our future. </p>
